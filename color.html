         learning HTML. HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is
          the backbone of every website, and I’m eager to understand
           how it works to create and design web pages.
            As someone who’s always curious
           about how websites are built, I’m looking forward to
            exploring  the basics of HTML
             and how it forms the structure 
        of the web. This is just the beginning, and I’m 
        ready to dive in and learn step by step!</p>
