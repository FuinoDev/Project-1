         HTML, or HyperText Markup Language,
          is the backbone of every website,
         and I’m eager to understand 
         how it works to create and
           design web pages.
         As someone who’s always curious 
        about how websites are built,
        I’m looking forward to exploring
        the basics of HTML and how it forms 
        the structure of the web. 
        This is just the beginning,
         and I’m ready to dive in and
          learn step by step!</span></p>
